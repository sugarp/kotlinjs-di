<h1>Primitive implementation of dependency injection for kotlin JS.</h1>

This is repository of a single file, which happened to be very useful when during development of a kotlin multiplatform application for Android and JS + ReactJS. 
When following MVP I ended up needing Dependency injection similar to Dagger for Java.

You define what is the current implementation of an interface:

and you simply inject it wherever you need. Because the injection is a function you can choose whether you create instance while injecting or return singleton.
